    <h2>How many Should We Put You Down For ?</h2>
    <p class="par">Posted By brain on octomber 1st ,2013at 2:39 pm <br/>the first big rule in sales is that if the person leaves empty-handed, they're skaly not going to come back That's why you have to be somewhat aggressive when you're working with a customer, but you have to mak you don't overdo it and scare them away</p>
    <P class="par">One way you can keep a conversation going is to avoid asking questions that have yes or no answers. For example, if you're selling a service plan, don't ever ask "Are you interested in our 3 or 5 year service plan? Instead, ask "Are you interested in the 3 year service plan or the 5 year plan, which is a better value? At first glance, they appear to be asking the same thing, and while a customer can still opt out, it's harder for them to opt out of the second question because they have to say more than that have to say more than just "no".</P>
